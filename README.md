# Restaurant-Automation-System
I have developed an application which can be used in any restaurant with just one time investment. The application is accessible only to the Customers, Manager and the Chef so that all can have the view of the orders placed. Main objective is to build the system that creates a working software environment which can handle the ordering process; in particular to the flow and storage of order information. Payment system will be included in the application for customers to pay the bills.Managers can have full access to the application while chef can only edi the menu with respect to the items made during the particular day.
